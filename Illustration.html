    <P> The infographic poster of Whales and Whaling was inspired by plenty of documentaries of whaling. Whales, like dolphins, always suffer different dangerous factors from extern environment. One of the most horrible influence is commercial whaling by people. Fortunately, commercial whaling is officially banned by International Whale Commission since 1986. I displayed a world choropleth map with three different colors to show each members’ position towards whaling. There are four countries which are still against the rule to whaling. Then, I draw two illustration charts to show whaling numbers in japan, and used each grid square to represent Japanese’s attitude to whales and percentage of Japanese who eat whale meat. Moreover, I employed visual illustration to produce directly of the purpose of whaling of each part of whale. At last, I draw seven different kinds of endangered whales to give an intuitive visual impact. </P>

    <p> This infographic poster was focus on Obamacare, also known as Affordable Care Act, which has significant influence on society. This infographic answered one question which is whether Obamacare works or not. I draw two illustrations to indicate that there are many of people enjoying beneficences after implementing Obamacare. I used line chart to show the fluctuation of number of people’s attitude to future directions as well as employing choropleth map to indicate Medicare beneficiaries of each state in the United State. Then, I adopted three line charts to display the percentage of uninsured people under different categories: age, poverty and ethnicity. Finally, I employed slope graph to indicate the premium paid to insurers before and after enactment of Obamacare in each state. All infographics showed that after enacting Obamacare, it did insure more people and lower the cost of the insurance. </p>

    <p> This infographic poster was inspired by a famous professor Hans Rosling in his TED speech about “Debunking myths about the third world.” One of the topic in the speech, the relationship between income and child mortality, arrested my interest. So, this poster talked about three main factors that affect infant mortality in Africa. First, I used choropleth map to show different rates of infant mortality in Africa with gradients. Then, I employed scatters plots and added a trend line to reveal the relationship between infant mortality and income per person. I draw four pie charts to display the portions of government health spending. Finally, I integrated two bar charts of “children per woman” and “infant mortality” in each country in Africa. </p>

    <p> Madagascar, officially the Republic of Madagascar and previously known as the Malagasy Republic,is an island country in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of Southeast Africa. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian peninsula around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth.</p>
